# Final Project - Segment 1

## Overview (Presentation) - Deliverable needs to be Google Slides
- Selected topic: Ukraine Sentiment Analysis
- Reason: Find out points of view by country on current developing situation in Ukraine 
- Source of data: Kaggle [Ukraine Conflict Twitter Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/bwandowando/ukraine-russian-crisis-twitter-dataset-1-2-m-rows?select=UkraineCombinedTweetsDeduped_MAR09.csv.gzip) *data collected on March 8, 2022
- Questions to be answered: 

    1. Would it be possible to know if the sentiments of the people of different countries change as per the political relations of Ukraine and Russia with those countries?
    2. Can the sentiment analysis support or explain the current migration trends from Ukraine to the neighbouring countries?
    3. What are the most common words used on social media (twitter) about the Ukraine-Russia conflict?
    4. What is the polarity distribution of the tweet sentiments?
    5. What are the most commmon reasons for negative or positive sentiments?
    6. People from which country have more neutral stand?
    7. How effective is the model in predicting sentiments for new tweets?

## Description of the communication protocols (github)

(create 4 branches in github, with at least 4 commits per person)

## Provisional Machine Learning Model (MLM)
The provisional machine learning model must accomplish:
- Outputs label(s) for input data

## Database
Provisional database must:
- [USA Provisional database](usa_tweets_dataset.csv)
- [Poland Provisional database](poland_tweets_dataset.csv)
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database



## Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. Extra ML verbiage here.

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on ___.
