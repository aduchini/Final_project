## Overview
The main goal of the present project was to identify the sentiments Twitter users have about the war in Ukraine.

### Topic Rationale
On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine demanding an assurance that Ukraine will never join NATO. Over a dozen cities and towns were attacked, including the capital city, Kyiv (Source: [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/world/europe/ukraine-maps.html?searchResultPosition=3))

Since then, there have been tensions between countries, in particular with the United States and European Union supporting Ukraine, and Russia counting with Venezuela and Syria as allies (Source: [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/05/world/americas/venezuela-russia-usa.html?searchResultPosition=1)). These tensions, according to media channels and specialists, can potentially escalate the Ukrainian war to a third world war.

Besides the threat of worldwide conflict, other impacts of the Russian invasion on Ukraine has already been observed. The most prominent impact is Ukrainians’ migration to neighboring countries, such as Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. Specialists have been calling it a major refugee crisis, as of March 11 over two and a half million Ukrainians have fled their homes (Source: [The UN Refugee Agency](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine#_ga=2.200929772.353981607.1646674903-2007428328.1646674903)).
Social media data can be used as a tool for evaluating sentiment for a standing government. Accurate sentiment analysis is a useful tool to predict outcome of events such as election results.
Many products, services and companies are openly discussed on social media. Detailed analysis of which could lead to feedback on public sentiment for these products or companies. It can also support the decision making process in businesses.
The public sentiment analysis about companies, products, and services can also aid stock market predictions, marketing, business & sales related forecasts.

### Data Source
Given the direct or indirect impact of the war in Ukraine to people’s lives, it is worthwhile to assess the sentiments people have about this event. Sentiments were identified through text data, consisting of over 11 million tweets downloaded from February 26 to March 19, 2022. Data was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/bwandowando/ukraine-russian-crisis-twitter-dataset-1-2-m-rows/discussion/310030). The dataset administrator used three processes to collect data:

- Process 1 hashtags: "#SlavaUkraini OR #Russia OR #RussiaUkraineWar OR #Putin OR #RussiaUkraine OR #RussianWar OR #ww3 OR #moscow OR #RussianConflict"
- Process 2 hashtags: "#ukraineunderattack OR #Ukriane OR #Ukraine OR #RussianUkrainianWar OR #UkraineRussia OR #UkraineConflict OR #UkraineWar OR #Kharkiv OR #StopPutinNow"
- Process 3: Geolocation UKRAINE country.

[The UN Refugee Agency](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine#_ga=2.176425381.1265551284.1648919578-2007428328.1646674903) served as a secondary data source. From this agency, we gathered the number of refugees fleeing Ukraine from February 24 to March 19, 2022, as well as the number of war casualties for the same period.

Other Data for Russia equipment and personnel losses as well as Ukraine Casualties have been sourced from the following:
- For Russia Losses:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/2022-ukraine-russian-war

- For Ukraine Losses: From 24th Feb, https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine

### Research Questions
Through the examination of tweet data, the following questions will be answered:

1. **What are the most common words mentioned on twitter about the Ukrainian war**?
2. **What is the sentiment breakdown for Ukraine war tweets**?
3. **How sentiment polarity changes over time**?
4. **Do sentiment distributions change according to country**?
5. **Is polarity related to the number of casualties in the war**?
6. **Is polarity related to the number of refugees fleeing Ukraine**?
7. **How accurate are Machine Learning models in predicting polarity based on tweet text**?


## Data Preprocessing

### Pre-processing Pipeline:
Typically data pre-processing for sentiment analysis requires removal of everything other than pure text data. After this initial cleaning process, pure text, goes through a NLP pipeline consisting of tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging and stop words removal etc.

However, due to VADER's capability of analyzing data as complete sentence the need for pre-processing the tweets is considerably minimized. The process followed for cleaning the tweets is described below.

### Cleaning Tweets:
The tweets contain a wide variety of emoticons, hashtags, mentions, special characters and hyperlinks. For the subject analysis simple textual sentences are needed to be passed to VADER. This is achieved by writing one function in python, that performs all of the aforementioned cleaning actions using regex. This function is then called on the entire dataset to render a cleaned tweets dataframe. 

## Sentiment Analysis

### About Sentiment Analysis:
Sentiment Analysis, also known as Opinion Mining, is a popular data mining approach used to study the inclination of people's sentiments, opinions and emotions towards any product, global issue, event, service and organization. The sentiments are typically extracted from the text reviews, comments and surveys using tools in Natural Language Processing(NLP), Machine learning and other computational linguistics.

### Sentiment Analysis Using VADER:
Notebook: [Data_Consolidation_Cleaning_And_Sentiment_Analysis](Data_Consolidation_Cleaning_And_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)

For the purpose of this analysis we are using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis. It is a trained NLTK lexicon that relies on a dictionary that maps words and other lexical features common to microblogs. It is a powerful tool specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.

Once the data is cleaned and ready for VADER, the data is analyzed by importing and using SentimentIntensityAnalyzer module from vaderSentiment package. The tweets are then passes through the analyzer and assigned polarity scores, using which we can further divide the tweets as positive, neutral and negative. Detailed demo of cleaning process and VADER sentiment analysis can be found in:

## Database Storage
The data (tweets data, casualty data, and migration data) has been loaded to an SQLite database using the Python sqlite3 library on [this notebook](SQL_database.ipynb). A left join for the 3 tables is performed on the date column (incorporating mean compound scores for tweets' sentiments). A copy of the output can be found in:
> [SQLite in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19K75J2ouPGdZb6Kk2lWZiYaIquHsYsT4/view?usp=sharing)

 It uses the following: [schema](resources/schema.sql), as laid out below:

## Statistical Analysis
Notebook: [Statistical_Analysis](Statistical_Analysis.ipynb)

### Hypothesis
A hypothesis of whether tweets sentiment polarity was related to other variables was tested. Specifically, Pearson correlation was used to test if the number of war casualties in Russia and Ukraine, the number of refugees fleeing Ukraine, the number of Russian prisoners and the day of the week was related to the compound polarity score.

H0: There is no linear relationship between variables.

H1: There is a positive or negative linear relationship between variables. 

### Correlation Matrix
As seen in the correlation matrix below, Pearson correlation values for the relationship between compound polarity and other variables were close to zero and p-values were greater than 0.05. The null hypothesis was then accepted and it was assumed that these variables are not linearly related.

![Correlation Matrix](resources/images/correlation_matrix.png)


There were significant negative relationships between date and number of migrants as well as number of casualties in Russia. These relationships might warrant more attention later in the analysis of how migration and casualties change across time.

### Scatter Matrix
Scatter plots were also generated to check if there was a clear non-linear relationship between compound polarity and other variables. From visual inspection of the scatter matrix below, points look spread out and there is no clear distribution pattern.

## Machine Learning

### Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning
After data was cleaned and sentiment scores was computed,
data preprocessing for Machine Learning included:
 - Dropping rows with neutral sentiment scores in order to get only a binary outcome: positive or negative.
 - Getting 1% of the dataset (n = 10,855) as sample to fit our computing resources.
 - Vectorizing the text data using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The TF-IDF method consists in converting the text into numerical vectors by calculating the frequency of each text unit and assigning less weight to most frequent units. The logic is that most frequent terms are less helpful in categorizing the dataset as they appear in most cases.

Most important features from TF-IDF
![Feature Importance](resources/images/feature_importance.png)

 - Defining the numeric vectors as X, independent variables or features.
 - Factorizing the variable sentiment score (from positive/negative to 0/1) and defining it as y, dependent variable.
 - Setting 80% of the sample data as training set and 20% as testing set. 

### Comparison of Classification Models
As the dependent variable is categorical and binary, classification algorithms were chosen. Because they are suited to text classification tasks and easy to interpret, the following algorithms were chosen:

- Random Forest
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Support Vector Classification (SVC)

The models performances were compared using boxplots of the model accuracy score:

![Machine Learning Models Boxplots](resources/images/ML_boxplots.png)

As seen in the image above, Linear SVC and Logistic Regression were the most accurate in predicting positive and negative outcomes from tweet text with 92% and 91% accuracy respectively. Linear SVC was then chosen for implementation.

### Implementation of Linear SVC 
Our data was best classified using Linear SVC, algorithm that finds the maximal margin that separates the data into the two categories (positive or negative sentiments).

The performance of the model was satisfactory, with 92% accuracy, 92% of average precision and 92% of average recall.

## Dashboard

### Tools Used
We have used Tableau for all our data visualizations and analysis. Tableau is also used to create a secure connection as an ODBC with Sqlite. Successful connection helps us access all our tables and databases and perform our analysis and visualizations effectively. Our final dashboard is published on Tableau Public.

### Interactive elements
Our Dashboard in Tableau Public has interactive elements, such as check boxes that provide the user flexibility to choose a country, select dates, or sentiments to update visualizations.

### Model Deployment
Finally the data visualizations has been deployed on Tableau Public and shared publicly, to [this Tableau viz](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ana.duchini/viz/Ukraine_analysis/Story1).

A website has been created with multiple interactive elements and all our project related details including visualizations and the machine models used. Various Tableau stories published in Tableau Public have been embedded in their respective webpages. 

## Conclusion
- Per the analysis, the most common words mention on Twitter about the conflict are associated with the hastags that were used to scrape the data. Some insight is provided by WordCloud images depicted in our visualizations.
- The sentiment breakdown follows a normal distribution, with a slight skew towards the negative, but a large portion of the tweets sit in the neutral column.
- Geographic patterns of sentiment polarities on the topic were identified, and found to vary according to country; more noticeably, the following countries, some of which have recently experienced conflict, indicated more sentiment polarities towards the negative: Siria, Yemen, Ethiopia, Iran, and Ukraine; while other countries, show a tendency towards the positive, such as: Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey, Belgium, and the U.K. A visual of this can be seen in the heatmap.
- The analysis shows that polarity is not related to number of refugees fleeing Ukraine, nor is it related to number of casualties. But it was found that number of refugees and casualties showed significant negative correlation with time.
- Finally, a Linear SVC classification algorithm was found to be the best predictor of VADER compound sentiments with a 92% precision and accuracy.

### Limitations
- Basing the analysis only on English language tweets contributes to bias on these results
- Restrictions to the use of Twitter in Russia, as well as China, also contributes bias to the sample used

### Future Analysis
- To reduce bias, including an analysis that includes tweets in other languages, for example, such as the ones spoken by the group members (i.e., Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi), would result helpful.
- Acquiring similar sample data from other social media sources, more readily available in countries with lower Twitter usage, such as Vkontakt and Sina Weibo.
- Exploring other NLP libraries,  to check if the sentiment distribution is equivalent and compare ML algorithm accuracy.
- Using Spacy (NLP library) to identify entities mentioned in Ukraine war tweets. 
- Conduct case studies of an entity image in relation to the war in Ukraine.
