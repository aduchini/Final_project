Final Project - Segment 1
# Analyzing the Sentiment Distribution of Tweets about the War in Ukraine
Using Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis, tweet data on the War in Ukraine was analyzed.

## Overview
The main goal of the present project was to identify the sentiments Twitter users have about the war in Ukraine.

On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine demanding an assurance that Ukraine will never join NATO. Over a dozen cities and towns were attacked, including the capital city, Kyiv.

Since then, there have been tensions between countries, in particular with the United States and European Union supporting Ukraine, and Russia counting with Venezuela and Syria as allies (include NYTimes source). These tensions, according to media channels and specialists, can potentially escalate the Ukrainian war to a third world war.

World impacts of the Russian invasion on Ukraine has already been observed. The most prominent impact is Ukrainians’ migration to neighboring countries, such as Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. Specialists have been calling it a major refugee crisis, as of March 11 over two and a half million Ukrainians have fled their home.

Given that the current war in Ukraine is having a worldwide impact, it is worthwhile to assess people’s sentiment about this  event. People’s sentiment were identified through text data, consisting of over one million tweets downloaded from February 26 to March 10, 2022.
