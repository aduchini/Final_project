# Final Project - Segment 1

## Background

### Social Media Analytics (SMA)
Social Media Analytics is used to collect data from various social media websites and evaluate the data effectively, in order to make business as well as logical decisions, based on the data received from end users. Social media is a great platform to understand the end user's sentiments, opinions and choices. SMA is used to analyze the customer's opinions on an emotional level to better understand the public opinion and analyze the polarity in events and issues of concern.

### What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment Analysis, also known as Opinion Mining, is a popular data mining approach used to study the inclination of people's views, sentiments, evaluations, opinions and emotions towards any products, global issues, events, services and organizations to name a few. These opinions are measured through Natural Language Processing(NLP), text analysis, Machine learning and other computational linguistics. Sentiment distribution is widely used to analyze the reaction of people and reveal the contextual polarity of the information used.

### Why Sentiment Analysis?



## Overview (Presentation)
- Selected topic
- Reason why they selected their topic
- Description of their source of data
- Questions they hope to answer with the data

## Description of the communication protocols (github)

(create 4 branches in github, with at least 4 commits per person)

## Provisional Machine Learning Model (MLM)
The provisional machine learning model must accomplish:
- Takes in data in from the provisional database
- Outputs label(s) for input data

## Database
Provisional database must:
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database



# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. Extra ML verbiage here.

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on ___.
